                    <p class="indent2">In Tears of Themis, the battle stages are called “debates,” wherein an opponent with HP 
                        (Health Points) will have various arguments against the player. Starting a debate costs AP (most of the time 10 AP). 
                        To win against the opponent, the player attacks each argument individually by selecting their cards to use—it will both 
                        deal damage to the argument and lower the opponent’s HP. <br><br>

                        The player has a limited amount of turns to complete the stage; and each card selection counts as a turn. 
                        If the player runs out of cards, they can refresh the deck at the cost of 1 turn. <br><br>
                        
                        On the other hand, the opponent counter attacks the player after each turn, dealing damage to lower the player’s HP. <br><br>
                        
                        Once all of the enemy’s arguments have been triumphed, the player wins the stage. However, 
                        the player loses the stage if they either (1) run out of turns or (2) their HP reaches 0. <br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent2">
                        Just like other famous games, Tears of Themis also has an attribute system. Attributes are the so-called “type” 
                        of the arguments and cards: Empathy, Intuition, Logic, and Null (only applicable to arguments).<br><br>

                        The attribute the player selects will contribute to the amount of damage they will deal during a single attack. 
                        If the player’s card has an attribute that overpowers the opponent’s, the attack will deal 1.5x damage; meanwhile, 
                        if the player’s card has an attribute that is overpowered by the opponent’s, the attack will deal 0.5x damage. 
                        Attacks against the Null or same-attribute arguments will deal 1.0x damage.<br>

                        A deck is the set of cards the player will use during debates. The deck consists of two parts: Primary Deck and Support Deck. <br><br>

                        The primary deck is the set of cards that will be used during debates.<br><br>

                        The cards in the support deck help improve the overall stats of the deck, but will not be used during debates. 
                        Furthermore, select skills in some cards may only be activated by placing the card in the support deck.<br>

                    <p class="indent2">
                        Tears of Themis is also a game which makes use of a “gacha” system—drawing from a randomized pool of Visions 
                        (manifested into cards) in return for a certain in-game currency (in this case, Tears of Themis—shortened to “Tears” by the fandom). 
                        “Shadows of Themis” are what the banners used for pulling are called, each having its own separate pity count depending on its type.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Tears of Themis</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        To pull for one Vision, one Tear is required; going by such logic, one ten-pull will cost 10 Tears. If the player 
                        lacks the Tears to pull, 180 S-Chips may be converted in order to gain 1 Tear. <br>
                        
                        <aside class="note">
                            <p>Note: To gain S-Chips, Gems may be used (obtained from paying with real money in Mall). However, it is not 
                            advisable to pre-convert Gems into S-Chips prior to pulling because they may be used to purchase goods from the Mall.</p>
                        </aside>
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        For large-scale events with Event Limited Shadows of Themis, such as Mysteries of the Lost Gold, there are two 
                        kinds of Tears to be used: Special Tears and Limited Tears. The game normally allows the player to convert S-Chips for 
                        Special Tears at a discounted rate (1,440 S-Chips for 10 Special Tears) a number of times during the limited banner period. <br>

                        <aside class="note">
                            <p>Note: After the event, any remaining Limited Tears will be converted into Stellin at a rate of 1:10,000; 
                                whereas remaining Special Tears will be converted into the regular Tears of Themis at a rate of 1:1.</p>

                    <p class="indent2">
                        The maximum number of draws to guarantee a SSR or SR Vision is called "pity." In all Shadow of Themis banners, 
                        an SR Vision or higher will appear within 10 pulls while an SSR Vision will appear within 100. 
                        A display counter for both SSR and SR pity is on each banner, above the Vision draw buttons. <br><br>

                        Once an SR Vision is obtained, the SR pity is restarted. Meanwhile, once an SSR Vision is obtained, 
                        both the SSR and SR pities are restarted.<br>

                        A log of Visions drawn for all kinds of banners can be found through 
                        Profile > Customer Service > Self-Search (Go to the Self-Search page) > Vision Logs. 
                        Note that only the Visions drawn within the last seven days will be displayed.<br>

                    <h3>Quests</h3>
                    <h4>Daily</h4>
                        <p class="indent2">
                            Everyday at 03:00 UTC+8, a new day begins for Tears of Themis. Completing these quests will reward the player EXP (experience points) 
                            and Activeness (which will manifest into rewards).<br><br>

                            Completing all daily quests and reaching all thresholds of Activeness rewards a total of 6700 EXP per day. <br><br>

                            On another note, daily sign-in rewards players for logging into the game for the day. The quantity of the rewards received can vary; 
                            there is an element of luck each day the player logs in, indicated by DAVIS' graphic on the login display.<br><br>

                            If DAVIS is:
                            <ul class="indent 2" style="margin-top:-10px;">

                                <li>Standing - reward increases by 50%</li>
                                <li>Cheering with flowers - reward doubles (note the reward always doubles on Day 26)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="indent2">
                            If the player purchased the monthly card, then the log-in rewards will be claimed through daily check-in.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <h4>Weekly</h4>
                        <p class="indent2">
                            After completing Main Story 4-18, Weekly Quests are unlocked. These are quests that reset weekly on Monday 03:00 UTC+8 UTC+8. 
                            Just like the daily quests, completing weekly quests will reward the player EXP and Activeness.<br>
                        </p>

                        <h4>Achievements</h4>

                            As the player progresses through the game, they complete achievements and earn rewards such as S-Chips or character level-up material. <br>

                    <p class="indent2">
                        The in-game Mall is where players may purchase packs using real or in-game currency, depending on the product.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Gems</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        This section of the Mall allows players to purchase Gems, Monthly Card, and the Investment Fund using real currency. 
                        For every 1 USD spent, the player garners 6 P-Points.<br><br>
 
                        <b>Monthly Card</b> <br><br>
                        The monthly card is a $4.99 USD (249.00 PHP) purchase  lasting 30 days per purchase.<br><br>

                        <b>Investment Fund</b> <br><br>
                        The Investment Fund is a $9.99 USD (499.00 PHP) pack that gives S-Chips when a player reaches a certain player level. 
                        The pack is retroactive: if a player purchases the pack when they are a higher level, they will also receive the 
                        rewards unlocked from lower levels.<br><br>
                    
                        <b>Total Purchases</b> <br><br>
                        Players can receive rewards from purchasing items that give P-Points. 1 USD is roughly equivalent to 6 P-Points. 
                        On accumulating a certain amount of P-Points, two Visions may be redeemed—an SR after reaching the threshold of 600 (Artem "Thin Veil") 
                        and an SSR at 5,000 (Marius "Matching Tattoos").<br><br>

                        The following packs are only available for a limited time, typically noted with a red timer banner at the top-left of the pack banner. 
                        These packs usually offer discounted prices than normal, usually appearing alongside events.<br><br>

                                Many gentle and good people of Stellis have somehow grown violent and volatile. These incidents may have been recorded,

                        Story stages include dialogues with the different male leads and NPC’s, interrogation portions, 3D investigation,

                        To conclude the main story chapter, the player attends a “court trial” and presents the evidence they have 
                        gathered to defend their client. At the end of the trial, the player battles the opposing body one last 
                        time before the stage is completed. <br><br>

                        Each debate stage when completed for the first time will provide the player with 40 S-Chips.<br>

                    <p class="indent2">
                        Similar to the anomaly stages, players battle in these stages to gain a hefty amount of S-Chips 
                        (amount depending how far the player is in this game mode). The difficulty of the debates increase the 
                        farther the player progresses in the 8-bit art styled game mode. Furthermore, playing through Trials of Themis 
                        will also unlock various difficulties for Temple of Trials<br><br>
                    
                        Unlike regular game modes, each level consists of two parts: a debate stage and a rewards portion.<br>

                            This has the same mechanics as all the other debates in the other game modes. Defeating the opponent in 
                            this stage will reward the player with S-Chips, as mentioned before.<br>
                        </p>

                    <h4>Rewards Portion</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        To gain extra rewards, the player will choose one among three possible options.These chests may contain Stellin x1400, 
                        Oracle of Justice II x6, or a Trials of Athena chest.<br><br>
                    
                        Trials of Athena Chests are small trivia quizzes that, when answered correctly, will reward the player with both 
                        Stellin and Oracle of Justice II. Otherwise, the player will receive no reward from this stage.<br>

                    <h3>Temple of Trials</h3>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        Temple of Trials is an extended version of Trials of Themis. For 30 AP, instead of 2 waves, Temple of Trials consists of 30 waves. 
                        The potential rewards for each wave consist of:<br>
                        
                        <ul class="indent 2" style="margin-top:-10px;">
                            <li>Treasure - Varies depending on Temple of Trials difficulty</li>
                            <li>Debate Stage - Grants S-Chip upon winning</li>
                            <li>Power Up - Boosts the strength of the player's cards for rest of the run</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent2">
                        When auto-debating, the AI will go straight through the middle by default unless moving to encounter a debate stage.<br>

                    <aside class="note">
                        <p>Note: There exists a limit to the amount of S-Chips to be obtained per week depending on how far the player has 
                            progressed in Trials of Themis. The counter resets every Monday, 03:00 UTC+8.</p>

                    <h3>Character Visit</h3>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        The player can choose to “visit” one of the love interests to interact with him and increase his affection level. 
                        As the love interests’ affection levels increase, more interactions with them are increased. This function is not 
                        available automatically at the start of the game—the love interests are complete in the Character Visit screen 
                        when the player has completed Main Story Chapter 4.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Chat</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        This is one way to raise the affection level with the chosen love interest. The player taps on the character to interact with them; 
                        alongside playing games with them, such as rock-paper-scissors or Old Maid. Their reactions and dialogues change depending on 
                        where you tap them and how high your affection level is.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Character Story</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        Character Stories are stages and stories dedicated to each love interest. In a sense, the character stories 
                        are the individual “routes” of the love interests, helping the player get to know the characters and their backstory more. 
                        HOWEVER, to clear debate stages, only the cards featuring the character chosen must be used.<br><br>

                        Each debate stage when completed for the first time will provide the player with 40 S-Chips.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent2">
                        Fieldwork is unlocked after completion of Main Story 04-18.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p class="indent2">
                            When the player first enters the fieldwork screen, DAVIS will conduct a tutorial for the player to understand the game mode. <br><br>

                            There are two categories of Fieldwork:
                            <ol class="indent 2">

                        <h4>Legal Aid</h4>
                        <p class="indent2">
                            There are four districts, each associated with a male lead, indicative of where they live:
                            <ul class="indent 2">
                                <li>Waterfront (Artem Wing) </li>
                                <li>Orchidshine (Marius von Hagen)</li>
                                <li>Long Beach (Vyn Richter)</li>
                                <li>South Stellis (Luke Pearce)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p class="indent2">
                            Handle cases in each district to increase Reputation in the corresponding district. Each of the four districts 
                            has its own independent Reputation Rating. Increase Reputation for each region to earn rewards. A new currency, 
                            Case Report, can also be earned and used to exchange for rewards in the Mall.<br><br>

                            This game mode utilizes a Fatigue system shared between districts. Fatigue is capped at 50 and will reset 
                            every day at 03:00 UTC+8. Players may use 60 S-Chips to temporarily increase Fatigue cap by 20 for the day (limit twice per day). <br>
                        </p>

                        <h4>Special Consultation</h4>
                        <p class="indent2">
                            The Special Consultation functions almost the same as Legal Aid, with only minimal changes.<br><br>

                    <h3 class="content" style="margin-top: 40px;">Cards</h3>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        Cards are the main "units" and collectibles in the game. Each card features a unique illustration of the respective love interest. 
                        They are the core part of deck building and have various mechanics.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Stats</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        Every card has three sets of stats:
                        <ul class="indent 2">
                            <li>Influence: The attack stat of the card.</li>
                            <li>Defense: The defense stat of the card.</li>
                            <li>Power: Indicates the card's total strength based on its level, upgrade tier, and evolution tier.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Attribute</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        See: <a href="#gamemech"><i>gamemech</i></a><br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Rarity</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        The rarity of cards also contributes to the overall power of the cards. The rarer a card may be, the stronger it is. 
                        The rarity levels are as follows: SSR > SR > MR > R. <br><br>

                        On another note, the only card rarity with non-animated illustrations are R cards. Whereas, SSR Cards are the only 
                        cards that display a short animation upon attainment.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Enhancement</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        Oracle of Justice and Stellin can be used to level up cards to increase their stats. The amount of Oracle of 
                        Justice and Stellin required increases based on rarity and level.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Evolution</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        A player can evolve a card at Level 40, and for SR/SSR cards, Level 70 as well. Evolving a card increases a 
                        card's level cap from 40 to 70, and then 70 to 100. New skills will also be unlocked when evolving. <br><br>

                        In addition, the card’s illustration will also change when evolving. For SR/SSR cards, the first evolution 
                        will slightly change the card art, while the second evolution will have more visible changes. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Upgrading</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        When a player obtains a duplicate of a card, they will receive card fragments that can be used to upgrade a 
                        card to increase a card's Influence and Defense up to 4 times. This means a player can pull a card a maximum of 
                        5 times - the initial pull and four more times after - to completely max upgrade a card.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>Skill</h4>
                    <p class="indent2">
                        Card skills can be passive skills that automatically activate at battle start, or active skills which activate when a card is used. 
                        The majority of card skills affect Influence (Attack) or Defense, such as increasing a player's own Influence/Defense, 
                        dealing more damage to the enemy’s argument, or lowering an enemy's Influence/Defense.<br><br>

                        Card stories are unlocked when a player reaches certain level thresholds for the card. These card stories 
                        consist of dates and situations with the MC and the featured male lead in the card.<br><br>

                        Completing these card stories will also reward S-Chips and increase the Affection level with the character, 
                        which can be claimed when selecting the gift icon on the card from the Card Details screen. <br><br>

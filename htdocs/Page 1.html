            <p><i>Stellis, a city that rose from the clash of civilizations. <br><br>

                Modern tech has given it its radiant neon lights but also cast long shadows of obscurity. Lately, there has been an abnormal increase in the number of mental illness cases as well as incidents that threaten Stellis' social security. Many gentle and good people of Stellis have somehow grown violent and volatile. These incidents may have been recorded, but they are often drowned out in a flood of data. Yet someone took notice of them and compiled them for detailed analysis... Codenamed "X-NOTE", the project aims to peel away layers of obscuring data and reveal the hidden truth beneath. <br><br>
                
                When all is put on the scales of the law before Lady Justice, you will be the one to weigh their crimes in the balance.</i></p>

            <p>The story of Tears of Themis occurs in the year 2030, where technology has seemingly advanced greatly, in the fictional city of Stellis. The main character (whose name will be determined by the player) is a young female junior attorney who is 24 years old. As the main story chapters continue, the overarching mystery slowly becomes uncovered. The romantic elements of the game enter when any of the four love interests are involved.</p>
